# SP500Prediction
## This program is meant to predict whether or not the S&P 500 will increase or decrease.
<ul>
  <li>I used multiple predictors such as: </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Trends on close data</li>
    <li>Open</li>
    <li>Close</li>
    <li>High</li>
    <li>Low</li>
    <li>Rolling mean averages</li>
  </ul>
  <li> The model utilizes Python and its packages such as Pandas, Sci-kit Learn, and Yfinance</li>
  <li> I used a RandomForestClassifier ML model since it can predict with high accuracy in large datasets and by minimizing overfitting</li>
</ul>

### In the end, I visualized the data and ML Model and ended up a with an accuracy of 54%
### This is a great base model which can be improved upon by adding other predicitors such as volatility, sentiment, etc...
